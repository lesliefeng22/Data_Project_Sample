# SAS_Project_Sample
  In this project, I implemented the methods and SAS programming skills to replicated a peer-reviewed reasearch paper. After completing the project, I am able to apply SAS to develop an analytic file, including identifying the data files and variables required, transforming variables into the measures of interest, and assessing the accuracy of my work; run and present the results of my analysis; describe the methods used to develop and analyze the data; and assess peer reviewed papersâ€™ clarity in describing their methods as well as note potential problems, if any, with the original analysis.

  The project aims to answer the research question that how did the health care expenditure of adults with diabetes vary according to different categories of co-morbid depression, which are no depression, unrecognized depression, asymptomatic depression, or symptomatic depression over eight years from 2004 to 2011 in the U.S.?
